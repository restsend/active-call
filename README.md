# Active Call

`active-call` is a standalone Rust crate designed for building AI Voice Agents. It provides a high-performance infrastructure for bridging AI models with real-word telephony and web communications.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Protocol Audio Gateway
`active-call` supports a wide range of communication protocols, ensuring compatibility with both legacy and modern systems:
- **SIP (Telephony)**: Supports standard SIP signaling. Can act as a **SIP Client/Extension** to register with PBX systems like **FreeSWITCH** or **Asterisk**, or handle direct SIP incoming/outgoing calls.
- **WebRTC**: Direct browser-to-agent communication with low-latency SRTP.
- **Voice over WebSocket**: A highly flexible API for custom integrations. Push raw PCM/encoded audio over WebSocket and receive real-time events.

### 2. Dual-Engine Dialogue Support
Choose the pipeline that fits your latency and cost requirements:
- **Traditional Serial Pipeline**: Integrated **VAD → ASR → LLM → TTS** flow. Supports various providers (OpenAI, Aliyun, Azure, Tencent) with optimized buffering and endpoints.
- **Realtime Streaming Pipeline**: Native support for **OpenAI/Azure Realtime API**. True full-duplex conversational AI with ultra-low latency, server-side VAD, and emotional nuance.

### 3. Playbook: The Best Practice for Dialogue
The **Playbook** system is our recommended way to build complex, stateful voice agents:
- **Markdown-Driven**: Define personas, instructions, and flows in readable Markdown files.
- **Stateful Scenes**: Manage conversation stages with easy transitions (`Scene` switching).
- **Tool Integration**: Built-in support for DTMF, SIP Refer (Transfer), and custom Function Calling.
- **Advanced Interaction**: Smart interruptions, filler word filtering, background ambiance, and automated post-call summaries via Webhooks.

### 4. High-Performance Media Core
- **Low-Latency VAD**: Includes **TinySilero** (optimized Rust implementation), significantly faster than standard ONNX models.
- **Flexible Processing Chain**: Easily add noise reduction, echo cancellation, or custom audio processors.
- **Codec Support**: PCM16, G.711 (PCMU/PCMA), G.722, and Opus.

## Protocol Flexibility

### Voice over WebSocket
For developers who need full control, `active-call` provides a raw audio-over-websocket interface. This is ideal for custom web apps or integration with existing AI pipelines where you want to handle the audio stream manually.

### SIP PBX Integration
`active-call` can be integrated into existing corporate telephony:
- **As an Extension**: Register `active-call` to your FreeSWITCH or Asterisk PBX like any other VoIP phone. AI agents can then receive calls from internal extensions or external trunks.
- **As a Trunk**: Handle incoming SIP traffic directly from carriers.

## VAD Performance

Benchmarked on 60 seconds of 16kHz audio (Release mode):

| VAD Engine      | Implementation   | Time (60s) | RTF (Ratio) | Note                   |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| **TinySilero**  | Rust (Optimized) | ~60.0 ms   | 0.0010      | >2.5x faster than ONNX |
| **ONNX Silero** | ONNX Runtime     | ~158.3 ms  | 0.0026      | Standard baseline      |
| **WebRTC VAD**  | C/C++ (Bind)     | ~3.1 ms    | 0.00005     | Legacy, less accurate  |

## API Documentation

## SDKs

- **Go SDK**: [rustpbxgo](https://github.com/restsend/rustpbxgo) - Official Go client for building voice applications with `active-call`.

## Dialogue Features

`active-call` provides a rich set of features for building natural and responsive voice agents:

- **Scene Management (Playbook)**:
  - **Markdown-based configuration**: Define agent behavior using simple Markdown files.
  - **Multiple Scenes**: Split long conversations into manageable stages (Scenes) using `# Scene: name` headers.
  - **Dynamic Variables**: Supports `{{ variable }}` syntax using [minijinja](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja) for personalized prompts.
  - **LLM Integration**: Streaming responses with configurable prompts and tool-like tags.
  - **Background Ambiance**: Supports looping background audio (e.g., office noise) with auto-ducking during conversation.
  - **DTMF Support**: Standard IVR functionality. Define global or scene-specific keypress actions (jump to scene, transfer call, or hang up).
  - **Pre-recorded Audio**: Play fixed audio files (`.wav`/`.pcm`) by adding `<play file="path/to/audio.wav" />` at the beginning of a scene.
  - **Post-hook & Summary**: Automatically generate conversation summaries and send them to a Webhook URL after the call ends. Supports multiple summary templates:
    - `short`: One or two sentence summary.
    - `detailed`: Comprehensive summary with key points and decisions.
    - `intent`: Extracted user intent.
    - `json`: Structured JSON summary.
    - `custom`: Fully custom summary prompt.

- **Advanced Voice Interaction**:
  - **Smart Interruption**: Multiple strategies (`vad`, `asr`, or `both`), filler word filtering, and protection periods.
  - **Graceful Interruption**: Supports audio fade-out instead of hard cuts when the user starts speaking.
  - **EOU (End of Utterance) Optimization**: Starts LLM inference as soon as silence is detected, before ASR final results are ready.

## Playbook Configuration

Playbooks are defined in Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. The frontmatter configures the voice capabilities, while the body defines the agent's persona and instructions.

### Example

```markdown
---
asr:
  provider: "openai"
tts:
  provider: "openai"
llm:
  provider: "openai"
  model: "gpt-4-turbo"
dtmf:
  "0": { action: "hangup" }
posthook:
  url: "https://api.example.com/webhook"
  summary: "detailed"
  includeHistory: true
---

# Scene: greeting
<dtmf digit="1" action="goto" scene="tech_support" />

You are a friendly AI for {{ company_name }}. 
Greet the caller and ask if they need technical support (Press 1) or billing help.

# Scene: tech_support
You are now in tech support. How can I help with your system?
